# Welcome to gits-statuses
In this repo you can find both PowerShell and Python scripts that once executed into the root directory where you have all your local repos
give you a table in output that shows repo status information like branch name, commits ahead/behind, changed files, untracked files, and more, 
in a similar way oh-my-posh provides on the prompt, but here you have a massive view of all your repos.

# How to use it

Clone the repo in the same folder you have all your repos

```
git clone https://github.com/nicolgit/gits-statuses  
```

## PowerShell Version

Then type:

```bash
# Basic usage - scan current directory
.\gits-statuses\run.ps1

# Detailed view with full remote URLs
.\gits-statuses\run.ps1 -Detailed

# Scan a specific directory
.\gits-statuses\run.ps1 -Path "C:\MyProjects"

# Show help
.\gits-statuses\run.ps1 -Help
```

## Python Version

Alternatively, you can use the Python CLI package:

Note: Refer to [these](https://github.com/nicolgit/gits-statuses/blob/main/python-pypi/README.md) installation instructions found in `/python-pypi/README.md`.

```bash
# Basic usage - scan current directory
gits-statuses

# Detailed view with remote URLs and total commits
gits-statuses --detailed

# Scan a specific directory
gits-statuses --path /path/to/projects

# Show help
gits-statuses --help
```

### Features

Both scripts provide:

**Standard View:**
- Repository name
- Current branch
- Commits ahead of remote
- Commits behind remote  
- Changed files count
- Untracked files count
- Only shows repositories with changes (clean repos are hidden)

**Detailed View:**
- All columns from standard view
- Total commits count
- Status summary (e.g., "↑1 ~2 ?3" for 1 ahead, 2 changed, 3 untracked)
- Remote URL
- Shows ALL repositories (including clean ones)

**Enhanced Summary:**
- Total repositories found
- Repositories with changes
- Repositories ahead of remote
- Repositories behind remote
- Repositories with untracked files
